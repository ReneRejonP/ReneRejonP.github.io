  My current research investigates the impacts of structural injustice on political representation. I use quantitative and qualitative empirical data to demonstrate race and gender-based marginalization in legislative institutions —primarily in Mexico and Latin America. I then use these empirical analyses to inform normative discussions about how to (practically) respond to these injustices. 
  
  My main areas of interests are political theory, legislative studies, sociology of race, and how these should inform public policy. However, I enjoy collaborating with scholars working on other topics and disciplines, particularly where my skills in digital tools enhance and buttress their projects. Currently, I’m supporting two large projects:
